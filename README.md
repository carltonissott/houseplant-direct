# HousePlant Direct
This was built over the course of three days and uses Hooks, React Router, React Redux and Google Firebase to operate.

The accounts are stored in Google Firebase Database and the photos are uploaded to Google Firebase Storage.

The biggest regret with this project was that I should of used custom hooks because I had to copy the fetch function into several different components whereas a custom hook would have easily solved this.
